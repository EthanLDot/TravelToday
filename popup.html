        <p>Chrome Extension
            1. Simple text manipulation/modification.
            2. We should attempt to analyze the webpage text in the body and try to extract any country names that are found
            3. The extension interface should either show when we click on the country name (if possible) or if we click on the extension itself on chrome.
            4. The interface should show either the individual country found or a list of countries and their travel restriction status (Closed, open with restrictions, open)
            5. The information to make that judgement will come from https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions
            
            Issues: accessing the information in the kayak is the only thing I dont have a clear solution for.
            1. Airtable, which means creating a dataset for 190+ countries which is kinda dumb and not flexible
            2. Somehow accessing the html of the kayak site and specifically looking for the html element that says "Open", "Closed", "Open with restrictions"
            2 is probably the better choice but harder
            
            
            Kayak site, it's really good:https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions</p>
